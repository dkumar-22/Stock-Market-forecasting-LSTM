# Stock-Market-forecasting-LSTM
Stock Market Forecasting using Long Short Term Memory. The Dataset Used was for Apple. An LSTM model based on their historical Stock Prices was built which was able to predict and forecast the stock prices for the next 30 days after the Dataset end date.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. There are three different gates in an LSTM cell: a forget gate, an input gate, and an output gate. Relative insensitivity to gap length due to these gates solves the long-term dependency problem is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.
